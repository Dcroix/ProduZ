# ProduZ v1.0
ProduZ is an online application designed for the convenience of researchers comparing performance between and across groups 
through experiments. It is authored and maintained by Paolo Hilado of Colegio San Agustin - Bacolod, Philippines. It is powered by R to 
carry out Descriptive and Inferential Statistics together with the creation of Boxplots for Data Visualization.The left side of this 
page shows its directory which contains five tabs: About ProduZ (current page), Sample Data, Two Group Comparison and Four Group Comparison. 
The About ProduZ tab provides a background of the application and the terms and conditions that apply upon use. The Sample Data tab provides 
an overview of how the data frame in the excel sheet should be organized in order to analyze data accordingly. If all is clear in terms of 
the structure of the data frame, head on to the Group Comparison (which ever is appropriate based on your experimental design) where users 
get to upload the excel file and have it processed for Descriptive and Inferential Analysis.
